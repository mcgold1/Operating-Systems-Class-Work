Nachos are a popular food based on nixtamalized corn, of Mexican origin associated with Tex-Mex cuisine that can be either made quickly to serve as a snack or prepared with more ingredients to make a full meal. In Mexico, they are rather called totopos. In their simplest form, nachos are tortilla chips (totopos) covered in nacho cheese or shredded cheese and/or salsa. Sometimes French fries, potato chips, or popcorn are used instead of tortilla chips. First created circa 1943 by Ignacio "Nacho" Anaya, the original nachos consisted of fried corn tortillas covered with melted cheddar cheese and sliced jalapeo peppers.
